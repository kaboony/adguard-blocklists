# YouTube DNS AdBlock List

This is a custom blocklist designed for **AdGuard DNS Cloud** or **AdGuard Home**.

## Features
- Blocks YouTube tracking and ad delivery domains at DNS level
- Removes requests to Google Ads domains (doubleclick, googlesyndication, etc.)

⚠️ Note: DNS filtering cannot remove inline YouTube ads (served from the same domains as videos).  
For full cosmetic filtering, also use AdGuard client or browser extension.

## Subscription URL
Once uploaded, use the **Raw GitHub URL** of the text file in your AdGuard DNS dashboard under:  
**Filters → Blocklists → Add blocklist**
